orangejuice
===========

orangejuice is an assembler for Magpie. The code examples throughout the documentation are all written for orangejuice.

Currently, orangejuice is early in development. It only supports assembling for bare metal (not that there's anything else to assemble for at the moment).

orangejuice can be found at the github respository here_.

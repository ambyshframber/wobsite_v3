- the "this is an anti-nft site" button is stolen from [arcade](https://arcadewise.me/), who also stole it. you are welcome to steal it too
- all buttons to the right of MOIST (including MOIST itself) are from [here](https://cyber.dabamos.de/88x31/)
- all my music is under [cc by-nc-sa](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/), so i can tell Bad People to stop making money off it if any decide to do so. if you want a commercial license, get in touch!

all my code is MIT, cuz it's a way more readable license than the gpl

# *uno*

uno is a card game, as i'm sure you are aware. uno has many oft-disputed subtleties in its ruleset, as i'm sure you are also aware. the week before last, i was on scout camp, and it was there that me and some other weirdos designed a partial ruleset to aid in disambiguating several parts of uno (when to play wild cards, stacking pickups, etc). it seemed to work, so i'm turning it into a full ruleset and publishing it to the Interwebs.

## the 2k22 uno ruleset (or, Uno as She Is Played)

the following is a (hopefully) unambiguous uno ruleset, designed by committee in a slightly damp field near knutsford.

### 1) overview

- 1.1) to begin a game, the deck is shuffled and each player is dealt 7 cards face down. the top card of the deck is then removed and placed face up. this card forms the base of the discard pile. the remainder of the deck becomes the draw pile.
- 1.2) play proceeds clockwise, starting from the player to the immediate left of the dealer.
- 1.3) if at any time, there are not enough cards in the draw pile for a player to draw the amount they are required to draw, every card in the discard pile EXCEPT the top card MUST be shuffled back into the draw pile. this occurs BEFORE the player draws any cards.
- 1.4) the first player who has no cards in their hand wins the game.

### 2) taking a turn

- 2.1) on your turn, if you can play a card, you MUST do so. (see section 3, playing a card)
- 2.2) if you cannot play a card, you MUST draw one card from the draw pile
    - 2.2.1) if this card is legal to play, you MUST play it.
- 2.3) if you end a turn on one card, you MUST clearly say "uno" before ending your turn.
    - 2.3.1) should you fail to say "uno", you must draw 6 cards.
    - 2.3.2) should the next player in line take their turn before you have a chance to say "uno" (an action henceforth referred to as "sniping"), that player draws 6 cards, not you.
    - 2.3.3) if it is unclear whether or not sniping has occurred, all players other than the "sniper" and "snipee" must vote to determine who draws. ties in the vote are broken by coin toss, or any other fair random method.

### 3) playing a card

- 3.1) to play a card, remove it from your hand and place it face up on the discard pile.
- 3.2) barring special cases, a card played must match the colour or symbol of the card on top of the discard pile.
    - 3.2.1) wild cards and +4 cards may be played on top of any other card.
    - 3.2.2) wild cards and +4 cards do not have a defined colour. after playing one of these cards, you must clearly communicate to other players what colour the card should represent.
- 3.3) a pickup card (+2 or +4) can be stacked on top of other pickup card. this will increase the total number of cards to be picked up. (see 4.1)
- 3.4) you may play 2 IDENTICAL cards in the same turn. "identical" here means that they have the same colour and symbol.
    - 3.4.1) if multiple pickup cards are played, the amount to pick up is added together (ie, two +2 cards would require the next player to pick up 4, or add 4 to the total if they were part of a chain)

### 4) special card effects

- 4.1) if the player directly before you has played a +2 or +4 card, and you cannot stack another pickup card on top of it, you must pick up the total number of cards in the current chain. you may not play a card after this event.
- 4.2) if the player directly before you has played a block card, you may not take a turn. do not play or draw any cards.
    - 4.2.1) if the player before you played 2 identical block cards, you must miss a turn and so must the player directly after you.
- 4.3) if any player plays a reverse card, the order of play reverses.
    - 4.3.1) if 2 identical reverse cards are played, the order of play is unaffected.
- 4.4) the red 4 is sacred (blame cerys)

# *kepler*

kepler is a [gemini](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/) server, written in just over 300 lines of rust and a lot of wishful thinking.
it currently runs [my gemini site](gemini://ambylastname.xyz/) and no others (as far as i am aware).

i chose the name kepler cuz a lot of other gemini stuff is named after space things, including the protocol itself.

documentation coming soon!

# *jamforth*

jamforth is my personal forth. it's based on the excellent [jonesforth](https://github.com/nornagon/jonesforth/), which i have mentioned before, but will gladly mention again. in fact it's mostly jonesforth. i just added some extra stuff.

### additional features include:

- [short-form and immediate conditionals](/blog/jamforth_conditionals.html)
- [random number generation](/blog/jamforth_rng.html)
- EVALUATE
- floating point

each of these will receive a blog post going into detail about how they work and why i made them, at some point.

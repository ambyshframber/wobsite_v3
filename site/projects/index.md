# *projects*

i like making things. i like watching projects come together over time into a functioning product. i like polishing things and publishing documentation about them. i think that's why i've made so much stuff. it scratches some deep itch to create, to bring new things into this huge world. i like naming things after birds.

but enough philosophy! i've made some stuff and i wanna show it off.

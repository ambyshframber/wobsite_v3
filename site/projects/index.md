# *projects*

i like making things. i like watching projects come together over time into a functioning product. i like polishing things and publishing documentation about them. i think that's why i've made so much stuff. it scratches some deep itch to create, to bring new things into this huge world.

but enough philosophy! i've made some stuff and i wanna show it off.

- [shiTTY](shiTTY), an awful terminal
- [kepler](kepler.html), a gemini server
- [avc2](avc2), a virtual cpu

## projects

[magpie](/magpie)! the main page of the magpie docs explains more, but basically i'm making another imaginary computer. i have an almost finished emulator and a half finished assembler. eventually&trade; i'm gonna make a tiny OS to run on it, maybe after i spec out and build a 32 bit version.

i'm working on and off on my website pretty much all the time. the main design hasnt changed in months, but every now and then i add a page or two.

i'm gonna buy patches for my jacket soon i promise

# *hello*

## welcome to amber jay allison lastname's Personal Corner Of The Web&trade;

hi! i am a programmer, musician and general dipshit (she/they). call me allison.
you can contact me on discord (allisonlastname), email (ambyshframber at gmail dot com),
or irc (if you happen to frequent Apionet or SkipIRC)

this website is built using an extremely homemade builder tool and a smidge of rsync.
i recommend viewing this site on a pc browser (it's usable on mobile, but it's not pretty)

the source code of this site is available [here](https://github.com/ambyshframber/wobsite_v3)

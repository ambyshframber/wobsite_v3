# *hello*

### welcome to amber jay allison lastname's Personal Corner Of The Web&trade;

hi! i am a programmer, musician and general dipshit (she/they).
you can contact me on discord (ambylastname#7968), email (ambyshframber at gmail dot com),
or irc (if you happen to frequent Apionet or SkipIRC)

this website is built using an extremely homemade builder tool and a smidge of rsync.
i don't quite have blog generation support set up yet, but i'm working on it.
i recommend viewing this site on a pc browser (it's usable on mobile, but it's not pretty)

the source code of this site is available [here](https://github.com/ambyshframber/wobsite_v3)

my music is available on [bandcamp](https://caliphate.bandcamp.com/releases)
and [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/caliphate00). please buy it x

welcome to amber jay allison lastname's personal corner of gemspace

## so who am i and what do i do?

i'm a transgender bisexual hacker girl or something. i write music, program things that may or may not need to be programmed, and occasionally perform digital necromancy.

this site is gonna be much lighter than my main site (on the big internet) because i have a much better content generator for that already. plus kepler (my gemini server) is a bit slow and hacky and i'm not sure how it would cope if i tried to hack in CGI.

## things i have done

=> shiTTY a 40*2 character lcd terminal
=> kepler kepler, my homemade gemini server
=> avc2 avc2, a virtual cpu
=> https://ambylastname.xyz my main site (https link)

## other pages of mostly nonsense

=> hacking.gmi hacking
=> cool_old_words.gmi old timey sounding words

## this capsule is part of low earth orbit

# kepler

kepler is a simple gemini server. it's written in rust and took me under 48 hours to go from "hey i should make this" to "hell yeah it works". as a result, it's more than a little hacky and somewhat untested.

the site you're viewing right now is running on kepler, which i'm honestly really proud of. i even have it set up as a systemd service so it launches on boot and everything!
